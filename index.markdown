Current testnets for the [Tezos](https://tezos.com) blockchain are listed here. [Read more](about/).

This list of Teztnets is also available in [json format](https://teztnets.com/teztnets.json).

# Long-running Teztnets

These networks are long-running test networks that are similar to mainnet. They run the same protocol as mainnet but switch over to the next protocol earlier than mainnet for testing. If you are developing applications, you probably want to develop on these networks.

# Protocol Teztnets

These test networks are deployed specifically to test individual Tezos protocols. There is usually one for the currently deployed protocol and one for the next protocol. If you are developing your application for the next protocol, you will want to use that test network.

# Periodic Teztnets

These test networks restart regularly and track the development of the master branch of [Octez repo](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/).
 
☠️ You probably don't want to use these unless you are a core protocol developer.
